1 Points are derived; penalties are ledger entries.
2 Provider corrections are proposals; auto-apply only when no outcome changes.
3 Manual overrides beat sync; divergence is flagged.
4 Locks derive from the stored kickoff time only.
5 Inbox is the source of truth; email is best-effort.
6 Aggregates are never stored in numeric columns.
7 Pick-on-behalf is write-only.
8 History reads sealed snapshots only.
9 Ledger entry_type is additive and parallel to reason; backfill by column default, never UPDATE.
10 Physical schema names govern; logical names in handoffs are documentation.
11 DB-enforced invariants are verified against the catalog, never assumed.
12 Typed ledger writes serialize per (pool_id, user_id).
13 Ledger-bearing pools and memberships are never hard-deleted.
14 Season is Pool; routes use /api/pools/:pool_id.
15 New tables and functions are deny-by-default to Data API roles.
16 Money input goes through one strict parser; never parseInt/parseFloat/Number.
17 Every evidence report states host class, database, user and server version.
18 Destructive work runs only on a disposable database; hosted gets migrate deploy only.
19 Legacy ASSESSMENT rows may be signed; typed rows are positive.
20 Per-pool authority derives from pools.admin_id; no global-role override.
21 Authorization defect fixes are code-only and precede new commissioner endpoints.
22 Money splitting is Decimal-only with characterization first; no zero-delta rows.
23 Every invariant carries an evidence status.
24 Period-close jobs are idempotent via a DB-enforced claim in the same transaction.
25 Acceptance tests assert behavior (SQLSTATE, row state), never message text.
26 Read routes are guarded like write routes; guards change access, never payloads.
27 Period-close preconditions use authoritative state; empty sets fail closed; no bypass flag.
28 VERIFIED requires numbers or raw output in the report body.
29 Isolation is by database, never by schema; the guard has three independent checks.
30 Raw evidence is unedited tool output; identifiers resolve; figures are consistent.
31 Irreversible operations run only from committed scripts with machine-checked preconditions.
32 The default environment is disposable; hosted credentials live in a separate file.
33 Docs are append-only, enforced by CI against a tagged baseline.
34 Every acceptance criterion maps to a named test or evidence item.
35 Tests never create or alter schema; databases reset via a guarded script.
36 A migration stays off the deployable branch until its hosted gate clears.
37 Evidence is produced by one committed script; empty sections fail; UTF-8 via spawn.
38 Trigger proofs run as a privileged role; privilege proofs as anon/authenticated.
39 Evidence and CI scripts measure inputs independently and ship with a negative control.
40 Every evidence run stamps commit, branch and time; identical output counts as not run.
41 A matrix row may cite only tests present in the committed JSON artifact.
42 Schema evidence comes from real pg_dump including ACLs, bodies and indexes.
43 Every ordered criterion appears in the matrix as PASS, FAIL or NOT VERIFIED.
44 Only a human runs or approves hosted changes; authorizations are typed in the conversation.
45 Rollbacks are generated from a pre-state snapshot and proven by hash equality.
46 External exposure is measured identically before and after a change.
47 Machine-checkable gates are decided by script exit codes.
48 Applied migrations are immutable; CI compares checksums.
49 Authorization scans cover every source of an identifier (path, query, body, headers).
50 Each test run begins with reset, migrate deploy and generate, and prints a header.
51 Tests are never deleted or weakened in non-test commits; controls run in a separate worktree.
52 Code depending on a schema object ships with its migration or fails closed.
53 Agents never push, force-push or change remotes.
54 GET handlers perform no writes.
55 A guard is never bypassed by a conditional when its dependency is missing.
56 Rulings are stored verbatim under docs/rulings/. The Decision Register in ARCHITECTURE.md is a byte-for-byte copy of docs/rulings/appendix-a.md, and CI diffs the two.
57 Every table written by a re-running job carries a database-enforced dedupe key.
