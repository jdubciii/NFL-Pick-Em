Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to \\?\C:\Users\kacone\Documents\AI and Tech\Antigravity\NFL Pick Em\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
(!) Your Vite config uses features that are unsupported by `configLoader: 'native'`, which is planned to become the default in a future major version of Vite:
  - ESM syntax in a file loaded as CommonJS (vitest.config.ts:1:1). Use a `.mjs` extension or set `"type": "module"` in the closest package.json
Set `VITE_CONFIG_NATIVE_IGNORE_WARNING=true` to suppress this warning.

## 8. LIVE REPOSITORY CONTEXT

### 8.1 Milestone 12.4 Design Specification (`docs/design/12.4.md`)
```markdown
# Milestone 12.4 Design Specification: Notification Retention, Archival & Pruning Engine

## 1. Architectural Scope & Tier Isolation (Decision #20 Hardening)
- **System Tier (Global Operations):**
  - Pruning & Retention Daemon: Scans terminal-state notification records (`DELIVERED`, `DEAD`) and expired inbox/outbox items past configured retention windows (e.g., 30-day retention for delivered events; 90-day retention for dead-letter diagnostics).
  - Archival Engine: Generates cold-storage archive snapshots or hard-deletes stale records in deterministic, bounded batches to prevent database transaction bloat and lock escalation.
  - Administrative Control Routes: Manual pruning triggers and retention metric queries hosted exclusively at `/api/admin/ops/retention/*` guarded strictly by `requireAdmin`.
- **Pool Tier Isolation:**
  - Zero retention policy configurations, archival triggers, or bulk deletion pathways are accessible under pool-scoped routes (`/api/pools/:pool_id/*`). Pool commissioners cannot alter retention thresholds or execute pruning.

## 2. Retention Policies, Batch Processing & Concurrency Invariants
- **Deterministic Retention Windows:**
  - `DELIVERED` events: Configurable retention period (default 30 days).
  - `DEAD` (DLQ) events: Extended retention period (default 90 days) preserving diagnostic metadata before final purging.
  - `INBOX` consumer records: Retained according to consumer acknowledgment and processing completion status.
- **Bounded Batch Processing (Decision #24 & #55):**
  - All pruning queries execute in bounded batches (e.g., LIMIT 500) within atomic transactions.
  - Prevents table-level lock contention and WAL spikes on active outbox/inbox tables.
- **Injectable Clock Interface:**
  - Retention threshold calculations accept an injectable `ClockFn: () => Date` to enable instant unit and integration testing across time horizons without real-time delays.

## 3. Operational & Security Invariants
- **Side-Effect Free GETs (Decision #54):**
  - Pruning executions and archival sweeps MUST require POST (`POST /api/admin/ops/retention/prune`).
  - GET requests (`GET /api/admin/ops/retention/status`) return queue depths, oldest event timestamps, and retention metrics with ZERO database mutations.
- **Fail-Closed Semantics (Decision #55):**
  - If a batch deletion fails or the claim store/database connection drops, the active transaction rolls back immediately and aborts the run, preventing corrupt or half-pruned batch states.
- **Audit Logging & Telemetry:**
  - Every pruning run logs an immutable summary record (rows deleted, batches completed, target status, execution duration).

## 4. Verification & Testing Strategy
- Unit test verification of batch boundaries and retention threshold calculations using `ClockFn`.
- Verification that active/pending (`PENDING`, `PROCESSING`) records are NEVER pruned regardless of age.
- Tier isolation tests proving `/api/admin/ops/retention/*` rejects pool commissioners and standard users with 401/403.
- Decision #54 compliance tests confirming GET status produces zero deletes.
- Decision #55 fail-closed assertions on mid-batch database errors.
```

### 8.6 Decision Register Appendix A (`docs/rulings/appendix-a.md`)
```markdown
1 Points are derived; penalties are ledger entries.
2 Provider corrections are proposals; auto-apply only when no outcome changes.
3 Manual overrides beat sync; divergence is flagged.
4 Locks derive from the stored kickoff time only.
5 Inbox is the source of truth; email is best-effort.
6 Aggregates are never stored in numeric columns.
7 Pick-on-behalf is write-only.
8 History reads sealed snapshots only.
9 Ledger entry_type is additive and parallel to reason; backfill by column default, never UPDATE.
10 Physical schema names govern; logical names in handoffs are documentation.
11 DB-enforced invariants are verified against the catalog, never assumed.
12 Typed ledger writes serialize per (pool_id, user_id).
13 Ledger-bearing pools and memberships are never hard-deleted.
14 Season is Pool; routes use /api/pools/:pool_id.
15 New tables and functions are deny-by-default to Data API roles.
16 Money input goes through one strict parser; never parseInt/parseFloat/Number.
17 Every evidence report states host class, database, user and server version.
18 Destructive work runs only on a disposable database; hosted gets migrate deploy only.
19 Legacy ASSESSMENT rows may be signed; typed rows are positive.
20 Per-pool authority derives from pools.admin_id; no global-role override.
21 Authorization defect fixes are code-only and precede new commissioner endpoints.
22 Money splitting is Decimal-only with characterization first; no zero-delta rows.
23 Every invariant carries an evidence status.
24 Period-close jobs are idempotent via a DB-enforced claim in the same transaction.
25 Acceptance tests assert behavior (SQLSTATE, row state), never message text.
26 Read routes are guarded like write routes; guards change access, never payloads.
27 Period-close preconditions use authoritative state; empty sets fail closed; no bypass flag.
28 VERIFIED requires numbers or raw output in the report body.
29 Isolation is by database, never by schema; the guard has three independent checks.
30 Raw evidence is unedited tool output; identifiers resolve; figures are consistent.
31 Irreversible operations run only from committed scripts with machine-checked preconditions.
32 The default environment is disposable; hosted credentials live in a separate file.
33 Docs are append-only, enforced by CI against a tagged baseline.
34 Every acceptance criterion maps to a named test or evidence item.
35 Tests never create or alter schema; databases reset via a guarded script.
36 A migration stays off the deployable branch until its hosted gate clears.
37 Evidence is produced by one committed script; empty sections fail; UTF-8 via spawn.
38 Trigger proofs run as a privileged role; privilege proofs as anon/authenticated.
39 Evidence and CI scripts measure inputs independently and ship with a negative control.
40 Every evidence run stamps commit, branch and time; identical output counts as not run.
41 A matrix row may cite only tests present in the committed JSON artifact.
42 Schema evidence comes from real pg_dump including ACLs, bodies and indexes.
43 Every ordered criterion appears in the matrix as PASS, FAIL or NOT VERIFIED.
44 Only a human runs or approves hosted changes; authorizations are typed in the conversation.
45 Rollbacks are generated from a pre-state snapshot and proven by hash equality.
46 External exposure is measured identically before and after a change.
47 Machine-checkable gates are decided by script exit codes.
48 Applied migrations are immutable; CI compares checksums.
49 Authorization scans cover every source of an identifier (path, query, body, headers).
50 Each test run begins with reset, migrate deploy and generate, and prints a header.
51 Tests are never deleted or weakened in non-test commits; controls run in a separate worktree.
52 Code depending on a schema object ships with its migration or fails closed.
53 Agents never push, force-push or change remotes.
54 GET handlers perform no writes.
55 A guard is never bypassed by a conditional when its dependency is missing.
56 Rulings are stored verbatim under docs/rulings/. The Decision Register in ARCHITECTURE.md is a byte-for-byte copy of docs/rulings/appendix-a.md, and CI diffs the two.
57 Every table written by a re-running job carries a database-enforced dedupe key.
58 Outbound payload sanitization is default-deny against an explicit per-type registry.
59 Outbox drain workers claim via FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED with explicit lease timeouts and discrete backoff.
60 Every claim of a leased job item counts as an attempt; the lease is verified before each send and when the result is recorded.
